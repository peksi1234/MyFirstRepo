How to Create a Bootable USB Stick Using Rufus and a Windows ISO File

    Download Rufus:
        Go to the Rufus website and download the latest version.

    Insert Your USB Stick:
        Plug in a USB stick (at least 8GB) into your computer.

    Open Rufus:
        Double-click the Rufus program to open it. No installation is needed.

    Select the USB Stick:
        Under "Device," select your USB stick from the drop-down menu.

    Choose the Windows ISO File:
        Click the "SELECT" button next to "Boot selection."
        Browse and select the Windows ISO file you downloaded.

    Start the Process:
        Leave other settings at their default values.
        Click "START" to begin creating the bootable USB stick.

    Wait for Completion:
        Rufus will warn you that all data on the USB stick will be destroyed. Click "OK" to confirm.
        Wait for the process to finish. It might take a few minutes.

    Eject the USB Stick:
        Once Rufus says "READY," safely eject the USB stick.

Your USB stick is now bootable with the Windows installation files. You can use it to install Windows on any compatible computer.
